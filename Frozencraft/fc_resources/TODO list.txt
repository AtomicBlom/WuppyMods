Quotes
-Olaf:
      "Hi everyone! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs"
      "It's so cute! It's like a little baby unicorn!"
      "I dont have a skull. Or bones"
      "Oh look at that, I've been impaled"
      "Some people are worth melting for"

-Sven:
       "Give me a carrot" (Kristoff voice acting as Sven)
       Possibly a noise he makes from the film. Cause he makes those weird snorting noises.

-Marshmallow:
      "Don't come back!"
      Maybe use his scream he does when he becomes angry.
